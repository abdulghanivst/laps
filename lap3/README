 Step 1: Library Setup:

Imported pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib for data handling and visualization.

Step 2: Data Loading:

Loaded the `Iris.csv` dataset into a DataFrame using the `read_csv` function.

Step 3: Data Cleaning:

- Checked for null values and duplicates.
- Dropped the Id column as it is not needed for statistical analysis.

Step 4: Statistical Exploration:

descriptive summary (mean, std, min, max) to understand the data distribution.

Step 5: Data Visualization
- Created a (Pair Plot) to see relationships between all features.
- Generated a (Heatmap) to show the correlation matrix between numeric variables.
- Visualized the count of each species to ensure the dataset is balanced.

Step 6: Final Conclusion
Identified that( Petal Length) and (Petal Width) are the most significant features for classifying Iris species.
